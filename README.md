*Ignore the name, even though this project is a lower class than Quizzgame, I enjoyed coding this project more because it's usage. I also learned how to use XML files.

## Usage

```bash
First open the server: 
      cd bin/
      ./server
Then open how many clients you want:
      ./client <loopback_ip_address> 60123.

<loopback_ip_address> should be 127.0.0.1
```

## To do's
